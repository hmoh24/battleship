# Battleship

A project to solidify **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and to conclude the **JavaScript track** on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship).


## 📖 Overview

**Battleship** (also known as *Battleships*) is a strategy guessing game for two players.

The game is played on ruled grids (paper or board), where each player secretly places a fleet of warships. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the opponent. Players take turns calling out coordinates to fire shots at the enemy’s grid.

The objective of the game is to **destroy the opposing player’s entire fleet**.


## 🧩 Rules

- Each player has a **10 × 10 grid**.
- Ships are placed **secretly** before the game begins.
- Ships **may not be placed diagonally**.
- Players alternate turns firing shots at the opponent’s grid.
- A player wins by destroying all of the opponent’s ships.


## 🚢 Fleet Composition

Each player has the following ships:

| Ship Type   | Size |
|-------------|-----:|
| Carrier     | 5    |
| Battleship | 4    |
| Cruiser    | 3    |
| Submarine  | 3    |
| Destroyer  | 2    |


## 🎯 Project Goals

- Practice **Test-Driven Development**
- Apply JavaScript fundamentals learned throughout the curriculum
- Build a complete project from specification to completion
